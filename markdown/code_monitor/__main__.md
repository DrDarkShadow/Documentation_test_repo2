## Overview

This file serves as the main entry point for the `code_monitor` package when executed as a module (e.g., `python -m code_monitor`). It integrates with the `click` command-line interface library to launch the core analysis functionality. The script calls the `analyze` function from a sibling module (`.main`) and includes logic to gracefully handle exits triggered by `click` for informational commands like `--help`.

## Functions

### `main()`

This function acts as the primary entry point for the command-line application. It invokes the `analyze` function, which contains the core logic of the tool.

It specifically calls `analyze` with `standalone_mode=False`. This is a common pattern when using `click` to indicate that the function is part of a larger command group and should not handle its own command-line parsing or execution flow independently.

*   **Parameters**: None
*   **Returns**: `None`

### Script Execution Block

The `if __name__ == "__main__":` block is the standard Python construct that runs when the script is executed directly.

It calls the `main()` function within a `try...except` block. This block is designed to catch `SystemExit` exceptions, which `click` raises after processing certain command-line arguments that terminate the program, such as `--help`. The code checks the exit code and only re-raises the exception if it's not a clean exit (i.e., the code is not `0` or `None`), preventing normal help-related exits from being treated as errors.

#### Usage Example

To run the application, you would execute the package as a module from your terminal:

```bash
python -m code_monitor [OPTIONS] [COMMAND]
```
